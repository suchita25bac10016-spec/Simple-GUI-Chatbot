Statement of the Project

## Problem Statement
Many users seek a simple and intuitive way to interact with chatbots without needing to understand command-line interfaces or complex setups. Existing chatbot systems often require technical expertise to operate or are embedded within web environments inaccessible offline. This project addresses the need for a lightweight, user-friendly chatbot GUI that runs locally, allowing straightforward conversations with basic, rule-based responses.

## Scope of the Project
This project covers the development of a desktop chatbot application using Python and Tkinter. It focuses on creating an interactive graphical interface for chatting, implementing fuzzy matching response logic, and loading predefined responses from a JSON file. The scope excludes advanced natural language processing, AI-powered responses, and server-based deployment, emphasizing simplicity and local usability.

## Target Users
Python learners and developers seeking to understand GUI programming and chatbot basics
Hobbyists interested in building desktop chatbot utilities
Users wanting an offline chatbot experience with customizable responses
Educators and students looking for a practical project combining UI and basic AI concepts

## High-level Features
Interactive chat window with scrollable conversation history
Real-time user input handling with a send button
Simple keyword-based response matching with fuzzy search for flexibility
Configurable responses through an external JSON file
Graceful exit commands to close the application
